# Website
This repository contains the Antora playbook and the GitHub actions needed to build and publish the website

## Structure

The content for each language's site is constructed from multiple components managed in the following repositories:

* [www](#Website) (this repository) contains the `antora-playbook` files for each language which describe how each language's site should be built and from which components. It also provides some additional `html`, `javascript` and `css` in the `supplemental-ui` directory which override the default content for all the sites.
* [Website-UI](https://github.com/LabVIEWCommunityTraining/website-ui) is used to create an antora `ui-bundle.zip` for each language - this defines the `html`,`css` and `javascript` used for each site
* [Website-Home-Section](https://github.com/LabVIEWCommunityTraining/website-home-section) provides a landing paged for each language and any other non-course related content
* [cti-documentation](https://github.com/LabVIEWCommunityTraining/cti-documentation) contains the course materials with different course-versions stored in different branches
* [Website-Course-Template](https://github.com/LabVIEWCommunityTraining/Website-Course-Template) provides a template for making new courses

The diagram below visualizes how content from each repository is combined for the `en` (English) language site but the method is the same for the `es` (Spanish), `fr` (French), `zh` (Chinese) sites.
